-- Faction lookup

-- ============================================================================
-- BOTH APIS, IN THAT ORDER  (1.9.1)
--   unit:get_race_id()     integer, the race the character was created as
--   unit:get_faction_id()  number, the faction template the unit belongs to
--
--   Race is asked first because it is unambiguous: a race maps to exactly one
--   side and never changes. get_faction_id is asked second, as corroboration
--   and as the fallback for the tick or two before the player object can
--   answer get_race_id.
--
--   Both are methods on GAME_OBJECT, not on unit_helper. unit_helper carries
--   is_valid_enemy, get_health_percentage, get_enemy_list_around and the rest,
--   and has no faction or race call at all - targeting.lua already uses it for
--   what it does have.

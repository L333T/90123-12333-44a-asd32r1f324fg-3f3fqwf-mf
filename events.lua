-- Master Farmer - Grindbot
-- Game events - the confirmations the client holds open until answered

-- ============================================================================
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--   Four game events are not notifications. They report an action the engine
--   has WITHHELD and is holding open until something answers it. Nothing times
--   them out. A plugin that never registers them simply stalls at the point
--   the client asked a question.
--
--   The bot was answering one of the four and ignoring the rest:
--
--     AUTOEQUIP_BIND_CONFIRM  answered already, by polling
--     EQUIP_BIND_CONFIRM      answered already, by polling
--     LOOT_BIND_CONFIRM       NOT ANSWERED - see below
--     CONFIRM_BINDER          not answered, never fired either
--
-- THE ONE THAT COST SOMETHING
--   Looting a bind-on-pickup item raises LOOT_BIND_CONFIRM and holds that slot
--   open. The bot never answered, so the slot never completed: every BoP drop
--   was left on the corpse while loot.lua burned its three attempts and gave
--   up. On a levelling grind bot that is precisely the loot worth having -
--   greens, blues, quest items.
--
--   The equip pair is different: core.game_ui.get_pending_equip_slot() latches
--   the value, so equip.lua could answer it by polling and does. There is NO
--   equivalent reader for the loot slot. The event is the only place the slot
--   number exists, which is why this file has to exist rather than being a
--   nicety.
--
-- THE OFF-BY-ONE
--   LOOT_BIND_CONFIRM reports WoW's 1-BASED loot slot. confirm_loot_slot takes
--   the 0-BASED index that loot_item and every get_loot_* reader use. Passing
--   args[1] straight through confirms the slot AFTER the one that asked - so a
--   naive forward is not a no-op, it accepts the wrong item.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT REGISTERED
--   The cast and aura families, and the combat log. The documentation is
--   explicit that a rotation should ask game_object what a unit is casting
--   right now rather than track edges, and every rotation here already polls.
--   Registering UNIT_SPELLCAST_* would fire for every nameplate in the zone to
--   answer a question nothing is asking.
--
-- REGISTERING ONCE
--   "Each plugin has a maximum number of callbacks; exceeding it raises a Lua
--   error, so register once." This plugin hot-reloads by clearing
--   package.loaded, which re-runs every module - so a module-local guard would
--   reset on each reload and register again until the cap blew. The guard
--   lives on _G.MasterFarmer_Grindbot, which survives a reload, and the
--   handler table is re-read through it so a reload still picks up new code.
